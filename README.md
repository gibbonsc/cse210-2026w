# cse210-2026w

This is my copy of the starter code for my students in CSE 210.

This repository contains the starter code for many different projects. They are arranged as follows:



`sandbox`

* An empty project that you can use to play around with any concepts you like.

  * I will create more sandboxes in here as I need them.



`csharp-prep`

* Starter projects for each of the C# Prep assignments.



`prepare`

* Starter projects for each of the preparation Learning Activities.



`prove`

* Starter projects for each of the prove Developer projects.



`final`

* Starter projects for final project.
